## Mailing lists

The project no longer uses mailing lists for discussion. Please open
issues in [the project](https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager)
with any bug reports, or question.

[The archives](https://lists.virt-tools.org/) are still available to
preserve the historical record.

## IRC

Developers can sometimes be found in the #virt channel on [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/)
